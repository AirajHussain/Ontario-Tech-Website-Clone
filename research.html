  <h1> Research Intrests <i class="fas fa-search-plus"></i></h1>
<p>  University graduates with the requisite knowledge and abilities to operate in the fast-paced world of IT are required for the information technology (IT) profession. Game Development and Interactive Media, Networking and Information Technology Security, and Technology Management are among the three programme majors offered by our university's Bachelor of Information Technology (Honours) degree. Each major equips you with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the field of information technology.</p>
<br>
<p>The Game Development and Interactive Media curriculum will teach you how to create compelling and effective interactive experiences. In a diversified team atmosphere, you will successfully improve your technical, artistic, managerial, and entrepreneurial knowledge and abilities. Working with programmers, artists, and designers will allow you to participate in the development of cutting-edge products that push the medium's boundaries. You will get the knowledge and skills necessary to rapidly advance your career in the gaming, digital entertainment, and simulation sectors, or to launch and manage your own videogames or interactive media studio as an entrepreneur. Several of Canada's best networking and information technology (IT) security experts have graduated from our programme. In this programme, users will implement basic concepts in basic and advanced networking, corporate network engineering, cloud services, coding, scripting, datasets, data encryption, policies, malware analysis, forensic work, and many other technical topics using cutting-edge hardware and research labs. The curriculum includes a mix of business and information technology studies to suit the demands of today's technologically advanced industry. Creative thinking, business intelligence, information systems, and IT security are among the skills you'll learn. Active learning opportunities like as internships, capstone projects, and foreign exchanges are available to you. In today's ever-changing business and technological world, they will provide you with the information and skills you need to become a successful project coordinator, director, or manager.</p>

<h1> Research Projects <i class="fas fa-tasks"></i></h1>
<h3>Project 1</h3>
<br>
<p> The Electric Vehicle Charging Station Demo Project was completed by the DSEA and its collaborators in July 2012, and the result was submitted to the Local Electric Distribution Companies Tomorrow Fund. The paper included an elevated evaluation of EV charging's effect on the electricity network, as well as hypotheses for the commercial rationale needed to encourage EV adoption. Moreover, it was discovered that trying to charge at home will indeed attract to the majority of private car drivers from a cost perspective, supporting the off-peak rationale desired by utility companies and power stations, and that community charging would be less attractive due to expense and the possibilities to exacerbate peak load.</p>

<h3>Project 2</h3>
<br>
<p>The study was viewed as a necessary step for the further research into the following topics: Impacts of recharging EVs on residential transformer loading, Impacts of recharging EVs on power systems voltage and current balance, EVs as a type of energy storage and their grid influence. The LDC Tomorrow Fund and Ontario Power Generation both contributed to the project's success (OPG). Ontario Power Generation, Durham College, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, eCamion, Oshawa PUC Networks, Intellimeter, WireIE, Town of Whitby, TetraTech, Siemens, Whitby Hydro, and Veridian Connections are among the DSEA team works in this initiative. The 'Durham Smart Grid Demonstration Project,' which included lead recruitment Siemens Canada, Oshawa PUC Connections Inc, Whitby Hydro, Veridian Connections, Intellimeter, Energent WirelE, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Durham College, City of Pickering, Region of Durham, and Smart Energy Tools, was a collaborative effort among several DSEA members. The purpose of the project was to create a command center for 3 companies that would allow them to interface, manage, deploy, analyze, analyse asset condition, and capacity forecast the systems.</p>
